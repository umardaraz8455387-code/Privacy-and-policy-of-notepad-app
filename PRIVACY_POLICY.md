Privacy Policy for Notepad – Notes & Reminder

Effective Date: 2025-09-24

1. Overview
Notepad – Notes & Reminder (the “App”) is designed for private, local note-taking and task reminders. We do not collect, sell, or share personal data. All notes, todos, and settings are stored on your device and are not transmitted to our servers.

2. Data We Do Not Collect
- We do not collect personal information (name, email, phone, contacts, photos, location, device identifiers, or analytics).
- We do not use third‑party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.

3. Data Stored Locally
- Notes and todos you create
- Optional due dates, reminder times, priorities, categories, tags, and colors
- App settings (e.g., theme, smart reminders toggle)
All of this remains on your device. Uninstalling the App removes this local data. Consider device‑level backups if needed.

4. Permissions We Use
- Notifications (POST_NOTIFICATIONS): To display reminders you schedule.
- Exact alarms (SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM / USE_EXACT_ALARM): To trigger reminders at the exact time you set.
These permissions are used solely to deliver core reminder functionality.

5. Children’s Privacy
The App is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. Parents or guardians who believe a child has provided data can remove it by uninstalling the App.

6. Security
We apply reasonable technical measures consistent with Android best practices. Because all data remains on your device, you control its security (e.g., device lock, backups).

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the Effective Date above and distributing the updated policy with the App and/or on our website if available.
